This dashboard will provide a comprehensive visualization of the stock price data with valuable analytics, making it a useful tool for further financial analysis.

-   The data will be obtained using the yfinance library,
-   The technical indicators will be calculated using the TA-Lib library.

-   The dashboard will be created using the Plotly library.
