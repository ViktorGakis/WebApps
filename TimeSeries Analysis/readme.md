# Stock Price Analytics

The idea is to create a financial interactive dashboard that will provide analytics regarding the

-   Technical
-   Fundamental

aspects of the stock in question.

This dashboard will provide a comprehensive visualization of the stock price data with valuable analytics, making it a useful tool for further financial analysis.

-   The data will be obtained using the yfinance library,
-   The technical indicators will be calculated using the TA-Lib library.

-   The dashboard will be created using the Plotly library.
